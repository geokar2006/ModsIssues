# Issues with my mods

## Frequently Asked Questions and suggestions

### How to download (get) the mod?

**You need to go to video description and see if the game needs obb. If the game needs obb, download it. Then find the link to the mod and download the mod, then install it (and obb, if needed).**

---

### The site with the mod doesn't work. What to do?

**You should open the site with VPN. If the site still doesn't work, wait until the site would be repaired.**

---

### How to install the mod?

**Click on the downloaded apk file and install it. The obb needs to be unpacked to '/sdcard/Android/obb/'. Here are 4 instructions on YouTube how to do this (not AD, just 4 random videos): [instruction apk+obb 1](https://youtu.be/wTchuKDJdA8?t=15), [instruction apk+obb 2](https://youtu.be/nXRkjgukFGM), [instruction apk 1](https://youtu.be/vK_jgnEe_8w), [instruction apk 2](https://youtu.be/9xISDk1BeWE).**

### How to download (get) the old mod version?

**The old mod versions cannot be downloaded.**

---

### What should I do if the mod crashes at startup (before the menu appears), if the black screen appears at startup (before the menu appears), if the game freezes at startup (before the menu appeared)?

**Basically, it means that the game crashed. Mods starting from BatIM (from 10/24/2022) have error catching system, that should copy the error during such a crash. Send the error here on github. [Instruction](#how-report-issue)**

---

### What should I do if the mod says that the crash occurred, but the game works?

**You can skip this error, as it is not critical. These errors are also [accepted](#how-report-issue), but it's not a fact that they can be fixed.**

---

### What should I do if the mod says that the crash occurred, and the game doesn't work?

**[Send](#how-report-issue) the errors to github.**

---

### "Make for iPhone" (iPad, etc.)

**I don't have Apple devices and I don't like them. The mods on this system without jailbreaking it or without developer's account are can't be normally installed. It's a difficulty not only for me, but also for you.**

---

### "Do without obb", "Can you do without obb?"

**I can't do it 100% without obb, because it's up to the authors to do it with or without it. I can make an installer, but it will occupy a lot of space as if you have 3 games installed. Installer's apk weighs like the game and the installed installer weighs like the game too. After installing the game, the game itself takes up space. It is irrational to waste so much space.**

---

## How report an issue?

### Rules
* **Don't write nonsense**
* **You should provide error if there is an issue with it (except: if this error is not received after several attempts)**
